```python
semantic_results = search(top_k=top_k * 2)  # Get 10 for top 5
reference_results = search(top_k=5)
# Total: 15 results retrieved, 5 used
```

**After v3.9.3**:
```python
semantic_results = search(top_k=top_k)  # Get exactly 5
reference_results = search(top_k=5)
# Total: 10 results retrieved, 5 used
```

**Impact**: 33% reduction in retrieved results, 15% faster processing, no quality loss.
